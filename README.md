# Dart Programs

This repository contains four Dart programs demonstrating various programming concepts such as control flow, loops, polymorphism, and mixins. Below are the details of each program.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

## Programs

### Program 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**File:** `even_odd.dart`

This program prompts the user to enter a number and checks if the number is even or odd.

#### Usage

```bash
dart even_odd.dart
```

**Example Input:**
```
Enter the number
5
```

**Example Output:**
```
The number is odd
```

### Program 2: Generate Fibonacci Numbers

**File:** `fibonacci.dart`

This program prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

#### Usage

```bash
dart fibonacci.dart
```

**Example Output:**
```
Fibonacci numbers:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

### Program 3: Calculate Area of Shapes Using Polymorphism

**File:** `shapes.dart`

This program calculates the area of a rectangle and a circle using polymorphism.

#### Usage

```bash
dart shapes.dart
```

**Example Output:**
```
Area of the rectangle: 100
Area of the circle: 314.0
```

### Program 4: Vehicle Speed with Maintenance using Mixin

**File:** `vehicle.dart`

This program defines a `Vehicle` class and demonstrates the use of mixins for adding functionality.

#### Usage

```bash
dart vehicle.dart
```

**Example Output:**
```
Car is running at 80.
Car is being serviced.
Bike is running at 80
```

## Running the Programs

1. Ensure you have Dart installed and properly set up on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the individual Dart files.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the Dart files.
5. Run each program using the `dart` command followed by the file name. For example:

```bash
dart even_odd.dart
```
